		<h1>Turnovers</h1>
		<ul>
		<li><span>13.1.</span>A turnover transfers possession of the disc from one team to the other and occurs when:</li>
		<ul><li><span>13.1.1.</span>the disc contacts the ground while it is not in the possession of an offensive player (a “down”);</li>
		<li><span>13.1.2.</span>the disc is handed over from one offensive player to another without ever being completely untouched by both players (a “hand-over”);</li>
		<li><span>13.1.3.</span>the thrower intentionally deflects a pass to themselves off another player (a “deflection”);</li>
		<li><span>13.1.4.</span>in attempting a pass, the thrower contacts the disc after release prior to the disc being contacted by another player (a “double touch”);</li>
		<li><span>13.1.5.</span>a pass is caught by a defensive player (an “interception”); </li>
		<li><span>13.1.6.</span>the disc becomes out-of bounds (an “out-of-bounds”); </li>
		<li><span>13.1.7.</span>the thrower has not released the disc before the marker first starts to say the word “ten” in the stall count (a “stall-out”);</li>
		<li><span>13.1.8.</span>there is an uncontested offensive receiving foul; or </li>
		<li><span>13.1.9.</span>during the pull, the receiving team touches the disc before it contacts the ground, and fails to catch the disc (a “dropped pull”).</li></ul>
		<li><span>13.2.</span>If it is unclear whether a turnover occurred, the player(s) with the best perspective quickly makes the call. If either team disagrees they may call "contest" and:</li>
		<ul><li><span>13.2.1.</span>the disc is returned to the thrower; and </li>
		<li><span>13.2.2.</span>any stall count restarts at maximum nine (9). </li></ul>
		<li><span>13.3.</span>If a fast count occurs in such a manner that the offence does not have a reasonable opportunity to call fast count before a stall-out, the play is treated as a contested stall- out (13.2).</li>
		<li><span>13.4.</span>If the thrower contests a stall-out but also attempts a pass, and the pass is incomplete, then the turnover stands and play continues.</li>
		<li><span>13.5.</span>After a turnover, the turnover location is where: </li>
		<ul><li><span>13.5.1.</span>the disc has come to a stop or is picked up by an offensive player; or </li>
		<li><span>13.5.2.</span>the intercepting player stops; or </li>
		<li><span>13.5.3.</span>the thrower was located, in the case of 13.1.2, 13.1.3, 13.1.4, 13.1.7; or </li>
		<li><span>13.5.4.</span>the uncontested offensive receiving foul occurred. </li></ul>
		<li><span>13.6.</span>If the turnover location is in the playing field proper, the thrower must establish the pivot at that point.</li>
		<li><span>13.7.</span>If the turnover location is in the offence’s attacking end zone, the thrower must establish the pivot at the nearest point on the goal line.</li>
		<li><span>13.8.</span>If the turnover location is in the offence’s defending end zone, the thrower may choose where to establish the pivot:</li>
		<ul><li><span>13.8.1.</span>at the turnover location, by staying at the turnover location or faking a pass; or </li>
		<li><span>13.8.2.</span>at the nearest point on the goal line to the turnover location, by moving from the turnover location.</li>
		<li><span>13.8.3.</span>Immediate movement or failure to move determines where to establish the pivot and cannot be reversed.</li></ul>
		<li><span>13.9.</span>If the turnover location is out-of-bounds, play continues according to Section 11.7. </li>
		<li><span>13.10.</span>If, after a turnover, play has continued unknowingly, play stops and the disc is returned to the turnover location, players resume their positions at the time the turnover occurred and play restarts with a check.</li>
		</ul>
