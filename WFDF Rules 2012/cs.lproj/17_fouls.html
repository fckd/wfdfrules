			<ul><li><span>17.3.1.</span>A Force-out Foul occurs when an airborne receiver catches the disc, and is fouled by a defensive player before landing, and the contact caused the receiver:</li>
				<ul><li><span>17.3.1.1.</span>to land out-of-bounds instead of in-bounds; or </li>
				<li><span>17.3.1.2.</span>to land in the playing field proper instead of their attacking end zone. </li></ul>
			<li><span>17.3.2.</span>If the receiver would have landed in their attacking end zone, it is a goal; </li>
			<li><span>17.3.3.</span>If the force-out foul is contested, the disc is returned to the thrower if the receiver landed out-of-bounds, otherwise the disc stays with the receiver.</li></ul>
		<li><span>17.4.</span>Defensive Throwing (Marking) Fouls: </li>
			<ul><li><span>17.4.1.</span>A Defensive Throwing Foul occurs when:</li>

		<li><span>17.5.</span>Strip Fouls: </li>
			<ul><li><span>17.5.1.</span>A Strip Foul occurs when a defensive foul causes the receiver or thrower to drop the disc after they have gained possession.</li>
