		<h1>Time-Outs</h1>
	
		<ul><li><span>20.1.</span>The player calling a time-out must form a "T" with their hands, or with one hand and the disc, and call "time-out" audibly to opposition players.</li>
		<li><span>20.2.</span>Each team shall have two (2) time-outs per half.  </li>
		<li><span>20.3.</span>A time-out may be taken at any moment within a half. </li>
		<li><span>20.4.</span>A time-out lasts two (2) minutes. </li>
		<li><span>20.5.</span>After the start of a point and prior to the ensuing pull, either team captain may call a time-out. The time-out extends the time between the start of the point and subsequent pull by two (2) minutes.</li>
		<li><span>20.6.</span>During play only the thrower, with an established pivot point, may call a time-out. After such a time-out:</li>
		<ul><li><span>20.6.1.</span>Substitutions are not allowed, except for injury. </li>
		<li><span>20.6.2.</span>Play is restarted at the same pivot point. </li>
		<li><span>20.6.3.</span>The thrower remains the same. </li>
		<li><span>20.6.4.</span>All other offensive players may then set up at any point on the playing field.  </li>
		<li><span>20.6.5.</span>Once the offensive players have selected positions, defensive players may set up at any point on the playing field.</li>
		<li><span>20.6.6.</span>The stall count remains the same, unless the marker has been switched. </li></ul>
		<li><span>20.7.</span>If the thrower attempts to call a time-out when their team has no remaining time-outs, play is stopped. The marker shall add two (2) seconds to the stall count before restarting play with a check. If this results in a stall count of ten (10) or above, this is a "stall-out" turnover. If there is no current stall count, the defence may initiate a stall count at three (3).</li>
		</ul>
