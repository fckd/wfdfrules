		<h1>The Pull</h1>
		<ul><li><span>7.1.</span>At the start of the game, after half-time or after a score, play commences with a throw- off, called a pull. </li>
		<ul><li><span>7.1.1.</span>Teams must prepare for the pull without unreasonable delay. </li></ul>
		<li><span>7.2.</span>The pull consists of a defensive player throwing the disc to begin play, after the offence is ready.</li>
		<li><span>7.3.</span>The offensive team signals their readiness by having at least one player raise a hand above their head.</li>
		<li><span>7.4.</span>Once ready, and until the pull is released, all offensive players must stand with one foot on their defending goal line without changing position relative to one another.</li>
		<li><span>7.5.</span>All defensive players must be entirely inside their defending end zone when the pull is released.</li>
		<li><span>7.6.</span>If a violation of 7.4 or 7.5 is called by the opposing team, the pull will be repeated. </li>
		<li><span>7.7.</span>As soon as the disc is released, all players may move in any direction. </li>
		<li><span>7.8.</span>No player on the defensive team may touch the disc after a pull until a member of the offensive team contacts the disc or the disc contacts the ground.</li>
		<li><span>7.9.</span>If an offensive player, in-bounds or out-of-bounds, touches the disc before it hits the ground, and the offensive team fails to catch it, that is a turnover (a “dropped pull”).</li>
		<li><span>7.10.</span>If the disc initially contacts the playing field and never becomes out-of-bounds, or is caught in-bounds, the thrower establishes the pivot where the disc stops.</li>
		<li><span>7.11.</span>If the disc initially contacts the playing field and then becomes out-of-bounds without contacting an offensive player, the thrower establishes the pivot at the point on the playing field proper closest to where the disc went out-of-bounds (Section 11.7).</li>
		<li><span>7.12.</span>If the disc becomes out-of-bounds after touching an offensive player, or an offensive player catches the pull out-of-bounds, the thrower establishes the pivot at the point on the playing field closest to where the disc became out-of-bounds (Section 11.5).</li>
		<li><span>7.13.</span>If the disc becomes out-of-bounds without first touching the playing field or an offensive player, the thrower may establish the pivot either at the brick mark closest to their defending end zone, or at the spot on the playing field proper closest to where the disc went out-of-bounds (Section 11.7). The brick option must be signalled by the intended thrower before picking up the disc by fully extending one arm above their head.</li>
