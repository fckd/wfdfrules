		<h1>Receivers and Positioning</h1>
		<ul>
		<li><span>12.1.</span>A player “catches” the disc by demonstrating sustained control of a non-spinning disc. </li>
		<li><span>12.2.</span>If the player loses control of the disc due to subsequent contact with the ground or a team-mate or a legitimately positioned opposition player, the catch is deemed to have not occurred.</li>
		<li><span>12.3.</span>The following are turnovers, and no catch is deemed to have occurred: </li>
		<ul><li><span>12.3.1.</span>an offensive receiver is out-of-bounds when they contact the disc; or </li>
		<li><span>12.3.2.</span>after catching the disc, an offensive receiver’s first contact is out-of-bounds while still in possession of the disc.</li></ul>
		<li><span>12.4.</span>After a catch, that player becomes the thrower. </li>
		<li><span>12.5.</span>If offensive and defensive players catch the disc simultaneously, the offence retains possession.</li>
		<li><span>12.6.</span>A player in an established position is entitled to remain in that position and should not be contacted by an opposing player.</li>
		<li><span>12.7.</span>When a player is making a play on the disc, an opposing player may not move to intentionally impede that player’s movements, unless they are also making a play on the disc.</li>
		<li><span>12.8.</span>Every player is entitled to occupy any position on the field not occupied by any opposing player, provided that they do not cause contact in taking such a position.</li>
		<li><span>12.9.</span>When the disc is in the air, all players must attempt to avoid contact with other players, and there is no situation where a player may justify initiating contact. “Making a play for the disc” is not a valid excuse for initiating contact with other players.</li>
		<li><span>12.10.</span>Some incidental contact, not affecting the outcome of the play or safety of players, may occur as two or more players move towards a single point simultaneously. Incidental contact should be minimized but is not considered a foul.</li>
		<li><span>12.11.</span>All players have the right to the space immediately above them. An opponent may not obstruct a player from occupying this space.</li>
		<li><span>12.12.</span>No player may physically assist the movement of another player. </li>
		</ul>
