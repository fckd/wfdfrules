		<h1>Infractions and Violations</h1>
		
		<ul><li><span>18.1.</span>Marking Infractions: </li>
			<ul><li><span>18.1.1.</span>Marking infractions include the following: </li>
				<ul><li><span>18.1.1.1.</span>“Fast Count” – the marker: </li>
					<ul><li><span>18.1.1.1.1.</span>starts the stall count before the disc is live, </li>
					<li><span>18.1.1.1.2.</span>does not start the stall count with the word “Stalling”, </li>
					<li><span>18.1.1.1.3.</span>counts in less than one second intervals, </li>
					<li><span>18.1.1.1.4.</span>does not subtract two (2) seconds from the stall count after the first call of any marking infraction, or</li>
					<li><span>18.1.1.1.5.</span>does not start the stall count from the correct number.  </li></ul>
				<li><span>18.1.1.2.</span>“Straddle” – a line between a defensive player’s feet contains the thrower’s pivot point.</li>
				<li><span>18.1.1.3.</span>“Disc Space” – any part of a defensive player is less than one disc diameter away from the torso or pivot of the thrower. However, if this situation is caused solely by movement of the thrower, it is not an infraction.</li>
				<li><span>18.1.1.4.</span>“Wrapping” – a defensive player uses their arms to prevent the thrower from pivoting in any direction.</li>
				<li><span>18.1.1.5.</span>"Double Team" - more than one defensive player is within three (3) metres of the thrower's pivot point and further than three (3) metres away from all other offensive players.</li>
				<li><span>18.1.1.6.</span>“Vision” - a defensive player uses any part of their body to intentionally obstruct the thrower’s vision.</li>
				<li><span>18.1.1.7.</span>"Contact" - a defensive player makes contact with the thrower prior to the thrower releasing the disc and not during the throwing motion. However, if this contact is caused solely by movement of the thrower, it is not an infraction.</li></ul>
			<li><span>18.1.2.</span>A marking infraction may be contested by the defence, in which case play stops. </li>
			<li><span>18.1.3.</span>On the first call of a marking infraction that is not contested, the marker must subtract two (2) from the stall count and continue.</li>
			<li><span>18.1.4.</span>The marker may not restart counting until any illegal positioning has been corrected. To do otherwise is a subsequent marking infraction.</li>
			<li><span>18.1.5.</span>For any subsequent uncontested marking infraction called during the same throwers possession, the marker must reset the count to one (1) and continue. </li>
			<li><span>18.1.6.</span>If the thrower attempts a pass and a marking infraction is called during the throwing motion or when the disc is in the air, the call has no consequences.</li></ul>
		<li><span>18.2.</span>“Travel” Infractions: </li>
			<ul><li><span>18.2.1.</span>The thrower may attempt a pass at any time as long as they are entirely in- bounds or have established an in-bounds pivot.</li>
			<li><span>18.2.2.</span>An in-bounds player who catches a pass while airborne may attempt a pass prior to contacting the ground.</li>
			<li><span>18.2.3.</span>After catching the disc, and landing in-bounds, the thrower must reduce speed as quickly as possible, without changing direction, until they have established a pivot point.</li>
				<ul><li><span>18.2.3.1.</span>The thrower may release the disc while reducing speed as long as they maintain contact with the playing field throughout the throwing motion.</li></ul>
			<li><span>18.2.4.</span>The thrower may change direction (“pivot”) only by establishing a “pivot point”, where one part of their body remains in constant contact with a certain spot on the playing field, called the “pivot point”.</li>
			<li><span>18.2.5.</span>A thrower who is lying down or kneeling does not need to establish a pivot. </li>
				<ul><li><span>18.2.5.1.</span>Once stopped, their centre of mass determines their pivot point, and they should not move away from that point while lying down or kneeling.</li>
				<li><span>18.2.5.2.</span>If they stand up, they must establish their pivot at that point. </li></ul>
			<li><span>18.2.6.</span>A travel infraction occurs if: </li>
				<ul><li><span>18.2.6.1.</span>the thrower establishes the pivot at an incorrect point on the playing field; </li>
				<li><span>18.2.6.2.</span>the thrower changes direction before establishing a pivot or releasing the disc;</li>
				<li><span>18.2.6.3.</span>the thrower fails to reduce their speed as quickly as possible; </li>
				<li><span>18.2.6.4.</span>the thrower fails to keep the established pivot until releasing the disc; </li>
				<li><span>18.2.6.5.</span>the thrower fails to maintain contact with the playing field throughout the throwing motion; or</li>
				<li><span>18.2.6.6.</span>a receiver purposefully bobbles, fumbles or delays the disc to themselves in order to move in any direction.</li></ul>
			<li><span>18.2.7.</span>After an uncontested travel infraction, play does not stop.  </li>
				<ul><li><span>18.2.7.1.</span>The thrower establishes a pivot at the correct spot, as indicated by the player who called the travel. This must occur without delay from either player involved.</li>
				<li><span>18.2.7.2.</span>Any stall count is paused, and the thrower may not throw the disc, until the pivot is established at the correct spot.</li>
				<li><span>18.2.7.3.</span>A defensive player should call “Play on” as soon as the pivot has been established.</li>
				<li><span>18.2.7.4.</span>The marker must say “Stalling” or “Play on” before restarting the stall count.</li></ul>
			<li><span>18.2.8.</span>If, after a travel infraction but before correcting the pivot, the thrower throws a completed pass, the defensive team may call "Violation". Play stops and the disc is returned to the thrower.</li>
			<li><span>18.2.9.</span>If, after a travel infraction, the thrower throws an incomplete pass, play shall continue.</li>
			<li><span>18.2.10.</span>After a contested travel infraction where the thrower has not released the disc, play stops.  </li></ul>
		<li><span>18.3.</span>“Pick” Violations: </li>
			<ul><li><span>18.3.1.</span>If a defensive player is closely covering an offensive player and they are prevented from moving towards/with that player by another player, that defensive player may call “Pick”.</li>
			<li><span>18.3.2.</span>Once play has stopped, the obstructed player may move to the position they determine they would have otherwise occupied if the obstruction had not occurred. The disc is returned to the thrower (if the disc was thrown) and any stall count restarts at maximum nine (9).</li></ul>
