	<h1 class="single">Introduction</h1>
	<p>Ultimate is a seven-a-side team sport played with a flying disc. It is played on a rectangular field, 
	about half the width of a football field, with an end zone at each end. The object of each team is 
	to score a goal by having a player catch a pass in the end zone that they are attacking. A thrower 
	may not run with the disc, but may pass the disc in any direction to any team-mate. Any time a 
	pass is incomplete, a turnover occurs, and the other team may take the disc to score in the 
	opposite end zone. Games are typically played to 17 goals and last around 100 minutes. Ultimate 
	is self-refereed and non-contact. The Spirit of the Game guides how players referee the game and 
	conduct themselves on the field.</p>
