	<h1>Spirit of the Game</h1>
	
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span>1.1.</span>Ultimate is a non-contact, self-refereed sport. All players are responsible for administering and adhering to the rules. Ultimate relies upon a Spirit of the Game that places the responsibility for fair play on every player.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>1.2.</span>It is trusted that no player will intentionally break the rules; thus there are no harsh penalties for breaches, but rather a method for resuming play in a manner which simulates what would most likely have occurred had there been no breach.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>1.3.</span>Players should be mindful of the fact that they are acting as referees in any arbitration between teams. In such situations, players must:
		</li>
		<li style="list-style: none">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span>1.3.1.</span>know the rules;
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>1.3.2.</span>be fair-minded and objective;
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>1.3.3.</span>be truthful;
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>1.3.4.</span>explain their viewpoint clearly and briefly;
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>1.3.5.</span>allow opponents a reasonable chance to speak;
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>1.3.6.</span>resolve disputes as quickly as possible; and
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>1.3.7.</span>use respectful language.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>1.4.</span>Highly competitive play is encouraged, but should never sacrifice the mutual respect between players, adherence to the agreed-upon rules of the game, or the basic joy of play.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>1.5.</span>The following actions are examples of good spirit:
		</li>
		<li style="list-style: none">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span>1.5.1.</span>informing a team-mate if they have made a wrong or unnecessary call or caused a foul or violation;
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>1.5.2.</span>retracting a call when you no longer believe the call was necessary;
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>1.5.3.</span>complimenting an opponent for good play or spirit;
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>1.5.4.</span>introducing yourself to your opponent; and
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>1.5.5.</span>reacting calmly towards disagreement or provocation.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>1.6.</span>The following actions are clear violations of the spirit of the game and must be avoided by all participants:
		</li>
		<li style="list-style: none">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span>1.6.1.</span>dangerous play and aggressive behaviour;
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>1.6.2.</span>intentional fouling or other intentional rule violations;
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>1.6.3.</span>taunting or intimidating opposing players;
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>1.6.4.</span>disrespectful celebration after scoring;
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>1.6.5.</span>making calls in retaliation to an opponent’s call; and
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>1.6.6.</span>calling for a pass from an opposition player.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>1.7.</span>Teams are guardians of the Spirit of the Game, and must:
		</li>
		<li style="list-style: none">
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span>1.7.1.</span>take responsibility for teaching their players the rules and good spirit;
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>1.7.2.</span>discipline players who display poor spirit; and
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>1.7.3.</span>provide constructive feedback to other teams about how to improve their adherence to the Spirit of the Game.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>1.8.</span>In the case where a novice player commits an infraction out of ignorance of the rules, experienced players are obliged to explain the infraction.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>1.9.</span>An experienced player, who offers advice on rules and guides on-field arbitration, may supervise games involving beginners or younger players.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>1.10.</span>Rules should be interpreted by the players directly involved in the play, or by players who had the best perspective on the play. Non-players, apart from the captain, should refrain from getting involved. However for calls relating to “out-of-bounds” and “down”, players may seek the perspective of non-players to assist them to make the appropriate call.
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>1.11.</span>If players cannot agree what occurred in a play, the disc shall be returned to the last non-disputed thrower.
		</li>
