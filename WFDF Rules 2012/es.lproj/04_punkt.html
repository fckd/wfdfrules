		<h1>Point, Goal and Game</h1>		
		<ul>
			<li><span>4.1.</span>A game consists of a number of points.  Each point ends with the scoring of a goal.</li>
		<li><span>4.2.</span>A game is finished and won by the first team to score seventeen (17) goals.</li>
		<li><span>4.3.</span>A game is separated into two (2) periods of play, called halves. Half time occurs when a team first scores nine (9) goals.</li>
		<li><span>4.4.</span>The first point of each half starts when the half starts.</li>
		<li><span>4.5.</span>After a goal is scored, and the game has not been won or half time has not been reached:</li>
		<ul><li><span>4.5.1.</span>the next point starts immediately; and</li>
		<li><span>4.5.2.</span>the teams switch the end zone that they are defending; and</li>
		<li><span>4.5.3.</span>the team that scored becomes defence and pulls next.</li></ul>
		<li><span>4.6.</span>A variation of the basic structure may be used to accommodate special competitions, number of players, age of players or available space.</li>
