		<li><span>8.1.3.</span>After a call which stops the play or any other stoppage, until the disc is checked in.</li></ul>
		<li><span>8.2.</span>A disc that is not dead is live. </li>
		<li><span>8.3.</span>The thrower may not transfer possession of a dead disc to another player. </li>
		<li><span>8.4.</span>Any player may attempt to stop a disc from rolling or sliding after it has hit the ground. </li>
		<li><span>8.5.</span>If, in attempting to stop such a disc, a player significantly alters the disc’s position, the opposition may call “Violation” and play restarts with a check at the location where the disc was contacted.</li>
