		<h1>Stall Count</h1>
		<ul><li><span>9.1.</span>The marker administers a stall count on the thrower by announcing “Stalling” and then counting from one (1) to ten (10). The interval between the start of each word in the stall count must be at least one (1) second.</li>
		<li><span>9.2.</span>The stall count must be clearly audible to the thrower. </li>
		<li><span>9.3.</span>The marker may only start a stall count when the disc is live. </li>
		<li><span>9.4.</span>The marker may only start and continue a stall count when they are within three (3) metres of the thrower and all defenders are legitimately positioned (Section 18.1). </li>
		<li><span>9.5.</span>If the marker moves more than three (3) metres from the thrower, or a different player becomes the marker, the stall count must be restarted at one (1).</li>
		<li><span>9.6.</span>To restart a stall count “at maximum n”, where “n” is a number between one (1) and nine (9), means to announce “stalling” followed by the count at one more than the last number uttered prior to the stoppage, or by “n” if that value is greater than “n”.</li>
