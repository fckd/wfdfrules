		<h1>Scoring</h1>
		<ul><li><span>14.1.</span>A goal is scored if an in-bounds player catches a legal pass and all of their first simultaneous points of contact after catching the disc are entirely within their attacking end zone (note 12.1, 12.2).</li>
		<li><span>14.2.</span>If a player in possession of the disc ends up completely behind the attacking goal line without scoring a goal according to 14.1, the player establishes the pivot at the nearest point of the goal line.</li>
		<li><span>14.3.</span>The time at which a goal is scored is when, after the disc is caught, contact is first made with the end zone.</li>
		</ul>
