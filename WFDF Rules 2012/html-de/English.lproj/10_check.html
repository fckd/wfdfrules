		<h1>The Check</h1>
		<ul>
		<li><span>10.1.</span>Whenever play stops during a point for a time-out, foul, violation, contested turnover, safety stoppage or injury stoppage, play shall restart as quickly as possible with a check.</li>
		<li><span>10.2.</span>Except in the case of a time-out: </li>
		<ul><li><span>10.2.1.</span>All players shall return to the positions they held when the event that caused the stoppage occurred.</li>
		<li><span>10.2.2.</span>If the disc was in the air when the event that caused the stoppage occurred, and the disc is returned to the thrower to restart play, all players shall return to the positions they held when the disc was released by the thrower.</li>
		<li><span>10.2.3.</span>All players must remain stationary in that position until the disc is checked in. </li></ul>
		<li><span>10.3.</span>Any player may briefly extend a stoppage of play to correct faulty equipment, but active play may not be stopped for this purpose.</li>
		<li><span>10.4.</span>The person checking the disc in must first verify with the nearest opposition player that their team is ready.</li>
		<li><span>10.5.</span>To restart play: </li>
		<ul><li><span>10.5.1.</span>if the disc is within reach of a defender, they shall touch the disc and call "Disc In";</li>
		<li><span>10.5.2.</span>if the disc is not within reach of a defender, the thrower shall touch the disc to the ground and call “Disc In”; or</li>
		<li><span>10.5.3.</span>if the disc is not within reach of a defender and there is no thrower, the defender nearest to the disc shall call “Disc In”.</li></ul>
		<li><span>10.6.</span>If the thrower attempts a pass before the check, or a violation of 10.2 is called, the pass does not count regardless of whether it is complete or incomplete, and possession reverts back to the thrower.</li></ul>
