	<h1>Continuation after a Foul or Violation Call</h1>



	<ul>
			<li><span>16.1.</span>Whenever a foul or violation call is made, play stops immediately and no turn over is possible.  </li>
		<ul>
			<li><span>16.1.1.</span>However, if the foul or violation is called: </li>
			<ul>
				<li><span>16.1.1.1.</span>against the thrower and the thrower subsequently attempts a pass, or </li>
				<li><span>16.1.1.2.</span>when the thrower is in the act of throwing, or </li>
				<li><span>16.1.1.3.</span>when the disc is in the air, then play continues until possession has been established.</li>
			</ul>
			<li><span>16.1.2.</span>Once possession has been established: </li>
			<ul>
				<li><span>16.1.2.1.</span>If the team that called the foul or violation gains or retains possession as a result of the pass, play shall continue. Players recognizing this should call “Play on” immediately to indicate that this rule has been invoked.</li>
				<li><span>16.1.2.2.</span>If the team that called the foul or violation does not gain or retain possession as a result of the pass, play shall be stopped.</li>
				<ul>
					<li><span>16.1.2.2.1.</span>If the team that called the foul or violation believes that possession has been affected by the foul or violation, the disc will be returned to the thrower for a check (unless the specific rule says otherwise).</li>
					<li><span>16.1.2.2.2.</span>If the team that called the foul or violation believes that possession has not been affected by the foul or violation, the play stands, they make up any positional disadvantage caused by the foul or violation, and restart play with a check.</li>
				</ul>
