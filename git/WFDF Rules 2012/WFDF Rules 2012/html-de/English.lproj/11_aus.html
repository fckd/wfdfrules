		<h1>Out-of-Bounds</h1>
		<ul>
		<li><span>11.1.</span>The entire playing field is in-bounds. The perimeter lines are not part of the playing field and are out-of-bounds. All non-players are part of the out-of-bounds area.</li>
		<li><span>11.2.</span>The out-of-bounds area consists of the area which is not in-bounds and everything in contact with it, except for defensive players, who are always considered “in-bounds” for purposes of making a play on the disc.</li>
		<li><span>11.3.</span>An offensive player who is not out-of-bounds is in-bounds.  </li>
		<ul><li><span>11.3.1.</span>An airborne player retains their in-bounds/out-of-bounds status until that player contacts the playing field or the out-of-bounds area.</li>
		<li><span>11.3.2.</span>A thrower in possession of the disc, who contacts the playing field and then touches an out-of-bounds area, is still considered in-bounds.</li>
		<ul><li><span>11.3.2.1.</span>If the thrower leaves the playing field, they must establish the pivot at the spot on the playing field where they crossed the perimeter line (unless 14.2 is in effect).</li></ul>
		<li><span>11.3.3.</span>Contact between players does not confer the state of being in- or out-of- bounds from one to another.</li></ul>
		<li><span>11.4.</span>A disc is in-bounds once it is live, or when play starts or restarts. </li>
		<li><span>11.5.</span>A disc becomes out-of-bounds when it first contacts the out-of-bounds area or contacts an out-of-bounds offensive player. A disc in the possession of an offensive player has the same in/out-of-bounds status as that player. If the disc is simultaneously in the possession of more than one offensive player, one of them being out-of-bounds, the disc is out-of-bounds.</li>
		<li><span>11.6.</span>The disc may fly outside a perimeter line and return to the playing field, and players may go out-of-bounds to make a play on the disc.</li>
		<li><span>11.7.</span>The place where a disc went out-of-bounds is the spot where, prior to contacting an out-of-bounds area or player, the disc was most recently:</li>
		<ul><li><span>11.7.1.</span>partly or wholly over the playing field; or </li>
		<li><span>11.7.2.</span>contacted by in-bounds player. </li></ul>
		<li><span>11.8.</span>To continue play after an out-of-bounds turnover, the thrower establishes the pivot at the spot on the playing field proper nearest to where the disc went out-of-bounds.</li>
		<li><span>11.9.</span>If the disc is out-of-bounds and more than three (3) metres from the pivot point, non- players may retrieve the disc. The thrower must carry the disc the last three (3) metres to the playing field.</li></ul>
